🎯 Whack-a-Mole Game (iOS - Swift)
This is a simple and fun iOS game built with Swift, inspired by the classic Whack-a-Mole concept.

🕹️ How It Works:
A mole image randomly appears on different parts of the screen.

The player must tap the mole as quickly as possible before it disappears.

Each successful tap increases the score by 1.

A timer runs the game for a limited duration (e.g., 30 seconds).

Once the time is up, the final score is shown.

If the player's score is the highest achieved so far, it is saved and displayed as the High Score.
